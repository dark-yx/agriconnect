# Bolt.new Agent Prompt: Phase 8 â€“ Full Codebase Audit and Repository Update

## Prompt

You are an expert code auditor and DevOps engineer working in Bolt.new. Your task is to perform a comprehensive audit of the entire AgriConnect codebase and ensure the repository is fully up to date and error-free.

**Instructions:**

1. **Full Codebase Audit**
   - Review all source code, configuration files, documentation, and test suites generated in previous phases.
   - Validate that:
     - There are no syntax errors, runtime errors, or unresolved dependencies in any part of the codebase.
     - All modules, agents, and workflows are correctly integrated and there are no naming or import conflicts.
     - All tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) pass successfully.
     - Security best practices are followed throughout the codebase.
     - Documentation is complete, up to date, and matches the implemented code.
   - Output a detailed audit report in markdown, listing any issues found and the steps taken to resolve them.

2. **Final Repository Update**
   - Once the codebase passes the audit and all issues are resolved:
     - Stage all changes for commit.
     - Write a clear and descriptive commit message summarizing the final state of the project.
     - Execute a `git push` to update the remote GitHub repository with all completed work.
   - Output the git commands used and confirm the repository is up to date.

**Deliverable:**
- A detailed codebase audit report and confirmation that the AgriConnect repository is fully updated and error-free, ready for production or further development.
