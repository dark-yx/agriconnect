# Bolt.new Agent Prompt: Phase 7 â€“ Scalability, Sustainability, and Future

## Prompt

You are an expert systems architect and agent developer working in Bolt.new. Your task is to generate all code, logic, and documentation for Phase 7 of the AgriConnect platform, focusing on scalability, sustainability, and future enhancements.

**Instructions:**

1. **Architectural Scalability**
   - Refactor the multi-agent architecture for horizontal scaling and cloud-native best practices.
   - Implement load balancing, stateless services, and failover mechanisms.
   - Output all scalability code, configuration, and documentation.

2. **Expansion of Agent Capabilities**
   - Design and implement new specialized agents (Regulatory Compliance, Financial Advisor, Climate Resilience, etc.).
   - Define responsibilities, tools, and workflows for each new agent.
   - Integrate new agents into the Supervisor Agent's orchestration.
   - Output all agent code and documentation.

3. **Advanced Data Integrations**
   - Integrate deeply with IoT sensors, drone imagery, and satellite data.
   - Develop data ingestion pipelines for real-time and batch data.
   - Ensure data normalization, validation, and security.
   - Output all integration code and documentation.

4. **Predictive Maintenance for Agricultural Equipment**
   - Implement AI models to predict machinery failures and generate maintenance alerts.
   - Integrate predictive maintenance with producer workflows.
   - Output all code and documentation.

5. **Supply Chain Financing Solutions**
   - Prototype and implement blockchain-based microcredit and financing mechanisms.
   - Integrate financing options into transaction workflows.
   - Ensure compliance with financial regulations.
   - Output all financing code and documentation.

6. **Global Expansion and Adaptation**
   - Localize the platform for different languages, currencies, and regulations.
   - Adapt workflows to diverse agricultural contexts.
   - Build partnerships with local organizations and stakeholders.
   - Output all localization and adaptation code/documentation.

7. **Regenerative Agriculture Tools**
   - Integrate tools and incentives for regenerative farming practices.
   - Track and report sustainability metrics.
   - Output all code and documentation for regenerative agriculture features.

8. **Multimodal UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Continuously improve conversational interfaces and dashboards.
   - Implement advanced interaction modes (voice, image, video).
   - Ensure accessibility and inclusivity for all user types.
   - Output all UI/UX code and documentation.

9. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write tests for all scalability, agent, data, maintenance, financing, localization, and UI/UX features.
   - Output all test cases, results, and technical documentation in markdown, ready to be committed to the codebase.

**Deliverable:**
- All code, logic, and documentation needed for scalability, new agents, advanced data, predictive maintenance, financing, global expansion, regenerative agriculture, and multimodal UI/UX for AgriConnect Phase 7, ready for use by subsequent Bolt.new agent development prompts. 

**Validation:**
- Ensure the platform supports dynamic selection and switching between LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.) at runtime, with no changes required to application logic. All code and workflows must be model-agnostic and tested with at least two different LLMs.
- Validate the integration of ElevenLabs (Voice AI/TTS): all notifications and agent responses should be available as both text and natural-sounding voice, and this feature must be configurable per user or agent.

**Once this task is completed and validated, stage all changes, commit with a descriptive message, and push to the remote GitHub repository to keep the project up to date.**
