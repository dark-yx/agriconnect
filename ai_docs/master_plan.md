   - Store transaction details in Supabase and on the blockchain.

3. **Blockchain Integration (Algorand)**
   - Set up an Algorand development environment (TestNet or DevNet).
   - Develop smart contracts for buying/selling transactions and for recording product origin.
   - Implement logic for agents to interact with smart contracts.

4. **Market Analyst Agent Development (Basic Level)**
   - LangGraph nodes to fetch simulated pricing data or from limited public agricultural data sources.
   - Provide basic price forecasts and trends.

5. **UI/UX Refinement for Transactions**
   - Purchase/sale flows, offer viewing, and contract acceptance.

## Phase 4: AI and Data Optimization

1. **Matching and Recommendation Algorithms Enhancement**
   - Implement ML algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering) for personalized product recommendations.
   - Develop product-buyer matching logic.

2. **Dynamic Pricing and Demand Forecasting Development**
   - Integrate AI/ML algorithms to dynamically adjust prices based on demand and inventory levels.
   - Develop demand forecasting models using time series analysis and ML models.
   - Consider integrating weather data and other external data via oracles.

3. **Reputation and Trust System Implementation**
   - Develop rating mechanisms and store reputation scores in Supabase.
   - Initial logic for Sybil attack prevention (e.g., basic identity verification).

4. **Quality Assurance Agent Development (Basic Level)**
   - LangGraph nodes to receive and store quality data (simulated initially).
   - Ability to flag basic quality issues.
   - Linking quality data to blockchain records for traceability.

5. **Advanced Search Refinement**
